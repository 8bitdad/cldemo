# Cumulus Linux - Demo packages


## Overview

This repo contains the source for the **cldemo** packages, these can be used by sales engineers, partners and customers to demonstrate:

* Automation tools (such as Ansible, CFEngine, Chef and Puppet)
* Configuration of routing protocols (OSPF, BGP etc)
* Zero touch provisioning
* Monitoring tools (Ganglia, etc)

Using dependencies the packages will automatically install any required components, configure them as appropriate and ensure content such as recipes, cookbooks, ztp scripts and playbooks are in place and ready.

Currently the primary target for these packages is within the hosted Cumulus Workbench, though in the near future we will be supporting installation on the customer or partner site using a standalone Ubuntu install.

## Usage

The Cumulus Workbench consists of a single pre-provisioned Ubuntu (currently 12.04) workbench/jump VM and multiple switches running Cumulus Linux.

From the workbench packages can be installed via APT:

	cumulus@wbench:~$ apt-cache search cldemo
	cldemo-wbench-ibgp-2s-ansible - 2 switch; Ansible, PTM and iBGP IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ibgp-2s2l-ansible - 2 leaf 2 spine; Ansible, PTM and iBGP IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ibgp-2s2l-puppet - 2 leaf 2 spine; Puppet, PTM and iBGP IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-2s-ansible - 2 switch; Ansible, PTM and OSPF Unnumbered IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-2s-puppet - 2 switch; Puppet, PTM and OSPF Unnumbered IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-2s2l-ansible - 2 leaf 2 spine; Ansible, PTM and OSPF Unnumbered IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-2s2l-puppet - 2 leaf 2 spine; Puppet, PTM and OSPF Unnumbered IPv4
	cldemo-wbench-sflow-2lt22s-puppet - Setup sflow and ganglia web frontend
	cumulus@wbench:~$ sudo apt-get install cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-2s2l-puppet
